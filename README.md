# ncurses-game-of-life

A simple Conway's Game of Life made with C and the ncurses library.

## Building

Just run `make` in the root folder of the repo. This will create `./conway_gol`

## Running
  There will be a new world randomly generated every time the program is ran. If you don't like the world, restart the program.

## TODO List
  - Add Sierpinski Triangle option
  - Add more cellular automata types
    - Rock, Paper, Scissors
    - Cave/Island generation
  - Move world drawing to separate window
  - Add a new window to hold instructions
  - Add stats that are displayed
  - Add 'R' keybinding to "reset world" and generate a new random initial world state.
