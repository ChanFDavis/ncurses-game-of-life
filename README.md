# ncurses-game-of-life
---
A simple Conway's Game of Life made with C and the ncurses library.

## Running
  There will be a new world randomly generated every time the program is ran. If you don't like the world,
close it and re-run it. 

Once you find one you like, press the SPACE key to start the simulation.
